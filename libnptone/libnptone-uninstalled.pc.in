# Note: As this file is sitting in ${top_builddir},
#           ${top_builddir} ~= ${pcfiledir}
#	and ${top_srcdir}   ~= ${pcfiledir}/@srcdir@
# Note: This refers to directory matches, not to string matches.
# Note: ${pcfiledir} already is an absolute path name, so there is
#       no much sense prepending a ${pc_top_builddir} before it.
